# Business problem
Mary is the owner of a small pharmacy located in a busy city center. She has been running the pharmacy for the past few years and has noticed that sales have stagnated. Despite the competitive pricing, Mary's Pharmacy has struggled to attract new customers.

To try and improve her business, Mary decided to contact Datafied Technologies to conduct a thorough analysis of her sales data using the transactional data collected over the past 6 years. She exports the data from her Point-of-Sale system, which includes information on the date and time of each sale, the name of the pharmaceutical drug sold, and the quantity of each drug sold.

You are the senior data analyst at Datafied Technologies. You are required to come up with business questions and generate metrics that could be tracked to identify trends and patterns in the sale of pharmaceutical drugs sold in the pharmacy over time. You also need to visualize the data and create dashboards to uncover hidden insights and track the metrics you have defined for the business.

Mary needs your help to uncover valuable insights about her business and take action to improve its performance. Mary intends to use this newfound knowledge to make informed decisions about her inventory and marketing strategies, ultimately leading to an increase in sales and the growth of her business.

# Dataset information
The dataset is built from the initial dataset consisting of transactional data collected in 6 years (period 2014-2019), indicating the date and time of sale, pharmaceutical drug brand name, and sold quantity, exported from the Point-of-Sale system in the individual pharmacy. The selected group of drugs from the dataset (57 drugs) is classified into the following Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System categories:

- M01AB - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Acetic acid derivatives, and related substances
- M01AE - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Propionic acid derivatives
- N02BA - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Salicylic acid and derivatives
- N02BE/B - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Pyrazolones and Anilides
- N05B - Psycholeptics drugs, Anxiolytic drugs
- N05C - Psycholeptics drugs, Hypnotics, and sedatives drugs
- R03 - Drugs for obstructive airway diseases
- R06 - Antihistamines for systemic use

# Project Objective
The objective of the project was to help Mary's Pharmacy improve its sales performance and overall business operations by analyzing transactional sales data and then create dashboard(s) that provide valuable insights the sales manager and CEO. The dashboard should uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities in the sale of pharmaceutical drugs, enabling informed decision-making and driving business growth.

Throughout the project, we were able to achieve the following:

## Understand Business Objectives and User Requirements
We tried to understand the specific requirements and objectives from the business problem. We identified key areas we want to focus on and the questions the business needs answers to. 

Some potential areas and questions included:
Which drugs have the highest sales revenue? 
What are the rush hours for the pharmacy? 
What are the top-selling drugs in each ATC category?

## Define Business Questions and Metrics
Based on the discussions in Step 1, we have defined specific business questions that the dashboard should answer. Example questions include:
- What is the overall sales trend for the pharmacy?
- Which drugs have the highest sales revenue?
- Are there any seasonal sales patterns for specific drugs or ATC categories?
- What time of the day has the highest sales?

## Define the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that will help answer the business questions. 
Example metrics include:
- Total sales revenue
- Quantity sold by drug or ATC category
- Sales growth rate
- Top-selling drugs by revenue or quantity
- Quantity growth rate.

## Preprocess the dataset:
Clean the data by removing duplicates, correcting any inconsistencies, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for analysis and visualization.
Creating additional features to give more robustness to our analysis.
3.2. Data modelling and relationships
Created dimensions table for drugs, date, and time
Created facts table.
Connected the tables to build our data model.

## Create visualizations and charts:
Use appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) to represent the metrics and insights.
Include interactive features such as filters, drill-down options, and tooltips for detailed information.
Create separate sections or tabs for different metrics or areas of analysis (Optional).

## Incorporate relevant insights and trends:
Highlight the most important insights and trends on the dashboard.
Use annotations, callouts, or text boxes to provide additional context and explanations (Optional).

## Dashboard Testing and Refinement
a. Schedule a one-on-one session with an instructor (Bariyat or Clara). This is to get feedback on your work done to see if you are meeting up with the requirement. B
b. Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments to the dashboard layout, visualizations, and insights.
c. Iterate the dashboard design based on the feedback received.

## Deployment and Documentation
a. Once the dashboard is finalized, deploy it to Power BI service using your created Power BI account.
b. Provide clear instructions on how to use the dashboard and interpret the visualizations via presentation. More information will be on this will be communicated.
c. Document
